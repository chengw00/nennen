The following changes were applied for the October 2015 release of the analog code.

As of 2015-10-27:

  a) fixed wind direction as a predictor problem by excluding standard
     deviation of zero (or only 1 sample size)

  b) removed hard-wired condition of positive definiteness, limit correction with
     "lower_limit_target_var" and "upper_limit_target_var" in namelist

  c) Options to compile: gfortran (must have 5.1 or higher) for both sequential and
     parallel and sequential for Intel Fortran. PGI fortran is not working yet and
     would require much more work (see README.txt)

  d) Added the following to the namelist (see README.txt for explanation):
      opt_metric_endday
      window
      trend
      method

      changed nday_start as negative to select the N most recent days, e.g.,
      nday_start = -5 for the 5 most recent days. Take note not go beyond
      the second last day.


  e) 4 different methods to use the analog code
     method =        ! 1 = AnEn, ANALOG ENSEMBLE AS IN DELLE MONACHE ET AL. 2013, MWR, 41, 3498-3516
                     ! 2 = KFAS, KALMAN FILTER ON ANALOG SPACE IDENTIFIED AS "ANKF"
                     !     IN DELLE MONACHE ET AL. 2011, MWR,  139, 3554-3570
                     ! 3 = KFAN; KF APPLIED TO AnEnMEAN, AS IN DJALALOVA ET AL. 2015, AE, 108, 76-87
                           AnEn WILL ALSO BE RUN AND OUTPUT AS WELL
                     ! 4 = AnEnMEAN, WEIGHTED MEAN OF AnEn, IDENTIFIED AS "AN" IN DELLE MONACHE ET AL.
                     !     2011, MWR,  139, 3554-3570. AnEn WILL ALSO BE RUN AND OUTPUT AS WELL


  f) new file format for ATEC operations (see README)
